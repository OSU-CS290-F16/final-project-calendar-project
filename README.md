# Final Project-Calendar/Class Schedule

Group members: Nehemiah Edwards(edwardne), Markus Woltjer(woltjerm), James Stallkamp(stallkaj)


We plan to design a website that combines a class calendar with a planner, so that you can schedule the school week between classes and homework. We will have a calendar that displays the whole month and can be switched to any month. The default will have the current date selected. Clicking on any date will allow you what’s going on for that specific day. The user can also add in which classes you are taking and which days they are on. This will include a form asking for location, instructor, time, etc. You can also add in homework and when it is due. This will bring up a form asking for details that include: due date/time, details about it, and which class it is for. You’ll be able to add midterms, finals, and breaks into the schedule. All classes, events and homework will be stored in the system. We plan on adding in some other features as it goes on to meet the requirements, and making the overall layout look nice.
